 ###    Explanation of hardstatus line    ##
 #
 ## Ignore the ' marks if you use these examples for yourself
 #
 ## Note that if you want to use the color brown under konsole
 ## You actually use bright yellow (%{Y}). 
 #
 ## Note the embeded space after the colon, I feel 
 ##  it just looks nicer with a blank between the
 ##  text and console edge:
 ##   '%{=b}%{G} Screen(s): '
 #
 ## This prints the window listing in blue:
 ##   '%{b}%w'
 #
 ## This right-aligns what follows:
 ##   '%='
 #
 ## This displays the time (hours and minutes) in 12hr format 
 ## and adds an AM/PM flag, in bold green:
 ##   '%{G}%C%A'
 #
 ## This displays the day of the week:
 ##   '%D'
 #
 ##This displays the date in Mon/day/year format:
 ## and again I embeded a space to give me one space
 ## between the text and console edge:
 ##  '%M/%d/%Y '
 #
 ## The resulting command give you a status line that 
 ##  looks like this: 
 ##   | Screen(s): 0* bash           5:30PM  Fri, Jun/25/2004 |
 ##  (The pipes indicate the edges of the xterm/console).
 #
 ## Green text, time, and date; windows in blue:
hardstatus alwayslastline "%{=b}%{G} Screen(s): %{b}%w %=%{kG} %D, %M/%d/%Y "

#hardstatus alwayslastline "%{=b}%{G} Screen(s): %{b}%w %=%{kG}%C%A  %D, %M/%d/%Y "

#hardstatus alwayslastline

# Change the hardstatus settings to give a window list at the bottom of the
# screen, with the time and date and with the current window highlighted
#hardstatus string '%{= mK}%-Lw%{= KW}%50>%n%f* %t%{= mK}%+Lw%< %{= kG}%-=%D %d %M %Y %c'
